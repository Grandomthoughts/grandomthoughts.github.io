      <description>This is mostly a place for me to keep all of my things together, but hopefully you can get some value out of it as well. Some things you will find on this site:
 Publications from projects with which, I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved. Projects that I worked on. Talks - Slides and details from my speaking engagements Posts that are mostly interesting content from around the tubes that I wanted to keep long term.</description>
