      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve updated the site. So, look, the old site was a ton of work to manage, and I don&amp;rsquo;t even think my mom was reading it. At any rate, I recently saw a few mentions of Hugo. I finally took the time to dig into it, and I really like the way it works. Basically, it is a static site generator. No more php. No more fiddly cms to deal with.</description>
