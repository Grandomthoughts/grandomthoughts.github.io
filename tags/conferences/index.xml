&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-take&#34;&gt;My take -&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;rvasec-is-really-turning-into-a-great-conference-each-year-the-team-adds-a-little-something-to-improve-it-mikko-mikko-hypponen-gave-the-keynote-and-as-expected-it-was-very-informative-and-had-plenty-of-humor-as-well-i-saw-some-great-talks-danielhbohannon-did-one-on-invoke-cradlecrafer-which-stood-out-to-me-i-also-enjoyed-the-managing-crowdsourced-security-testing-talk-that-codexwebsecurum-mike-shema-gave-wojeblaze-troy-wojewoda-and-0xderuke-derek-banks-did-a-presentation-on-using-open-source-tools-on-the-blue-team-to-catch-the-kinds-of-attack-techniques-used-by-red-team-finally-jake-smith-and-roman-bohuk-did-a-concise-job-of-summing-up-the-issues-with-preparing-the-next-generation-of-security-specialists-their-perspective-was-interesting-especially-since-they-are-both-in-high-school-i-look-forward-to-catching-a-few-more-once-they-are-posted-online&#34;&gt;RVASec is really turning into a great conference.  Each year the team adds a little something to improve it.  @mikko Mikko Hypponen gave the keynote, and as expected it was very informative, and had plenty of humor as well.  I saw some great talks, @danielhbohannon did one on Invoke-CradleCrafer, which stood out to me.  I also enjoyed the Managing Crowdsourced Security Testing talk that @CodexWebSecurum (Mike Shema) gave.  @wojeblaze (Troy Wojewoda) and @0xderuke (Derek Banks) did a presentation on using open-source tools on the blue team to catch the kinds of attack techniques used by red team.  Finally, Jake Smith and Roman Bohuk did a concise job of summing up the issues with preparing the next generation of security specialists.  Their perspective was interesting especially since they are both in high school.  I look forward to catching a few more once they are posted online.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;the-ctf-was-well-executed-and-is-one-of-my-favorites-new-lesson-learned-if-there-is-a-file-run-strings-on-it-every-time-first-thing-no-matter-what&#34;&gt;The CTF was well executed, and is one of my favorites.  New lesson learned.  If there is a file, run strings on it every time, first thing, no matter what.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;last-but-not-least-the-team-at-http-hackrva-org-deserve-a-round-of-applause-for-the-badges-makes-me-want-to-wear-a-32bit-computer-around-my-neck-everyday-i-mean-seriously-when-do-i-get-my-communicator-badge&#34;&gt;Last but not least, the team at &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackrva.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://hackrva.org/&lt;/a&gt; deserve a round of applause for the badges.  Makes me want to wear a 32bit computer around my neck everyday.  I mean seriously, when do I get my communicator badge?&lt;/h6&gt;
