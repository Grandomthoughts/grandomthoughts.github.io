      <description>This program enables intelligence community analysts and private sector partners to gain a greater understanding of how their disparate, yet complementary, roles can work in tandem to ensure mission success. The public-private teams collaborate for six months to work on unclassified analytic deliverables of interest to the IC and private sector. Federal as well as State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial analysts and private sector analysts apply on a volunteer basis to participate in this effort.</description>
